<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    I'm a Scala developer with a background in Java. These days I work in a Labs team at
    <a href="http://www.net-a-porter.com">Net-a-Porter</a> as an all-purpose server-side developer
    which is pretty awesome because I get to play around with lots of different tech every day.
    Do check out the Net-a-Porter <a href="http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/">tech blog</a>.

<h1>About this blog</h1>

<p>
    This blog is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>. Both are
    free and both are awesome.
</p>

<p>
    I write my posts in markdown, push them to a github repo and then Jekyll converts the markdown to HTML and
    publishes it to this very spot.
