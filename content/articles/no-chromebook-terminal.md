Title: Lost your Chromebook terminal?

I was lucky enough to get given a Chromebook whilst attending Google IO 2011 last year and I must admit - I really like it. At first I thought I would get annoyed at the inability to install local programs (other than Chrome and the shell it comes with) - in reality however, when at home, virtually all my computer usage is on the Chromebook. I guess a browser and shell is all I need.

The other day I turned on the Chromebook to find the terminal no longer worked. The usual Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard shortcut yielded no results. I know this problem didn't just effect me, because it also happened to my work colleague's Chromebook. Despite this, my first port of call (a quick google) resulted in nothing useful, so I thought I'd try a reinstall of Chrome OS.

# How do I get my terminal back?

Reinstalling Chrome OS only takes around 10 minutes and solved the problem for me - I got my beloved terminal back.

Follow [these instructions](http://support.google.com/chromeos/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1080595) to reinstall Chrome OS.

The good thing about being forced to run almost everything in the cloud is that when it comes to reinstalling the OS, you have nothing to lose! No local programs to reinstall. Provided you sync your settings, bookmarks, extensions and webstore apps to Google, you will automatically get them all back after the reinstall is complete.
