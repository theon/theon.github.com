I've mentioned in my previous posts how much I like my chromebook and last week Google released version 19 of Chrome OS, with some pretty major updates. I'll be honest; I'm not a fan of the changes. 

Why you ask? Well, Google made a bold statement with their initial release of Chrome OS - it was different from everything else. There was no desktop, just Chrome and a terminal (when switched to dev mode). It was truely a lightweight OS built for working in the cloud. With the release of Version 19, it feels like Google have buckled under the pressure to make their OS more friendly to the average user by providing them with the familar desktop paradigm. 

# Desktop Wallpaper

One of the big changes was the addition of a desktop with a wallpaper. When Google launched Chrome OS it was a pretty brave not to include a desktop, but they did it with good reason - there simply wasn't any point. When you just have chrome and not much else, there is not a whole lot of need for a desktop.

So why include one now? To be honest, I have no idea. You can't really use it for much. You can't drop files or shortcuts onto it. It does however allow you to resize your chrome windows. In previous versions of Chrome OS, browser windows were always maximised until you opened a second window at which point you were able to do some simple window tiling and I prefered the simplicity of this approach. My only guess is that they want to provide a more familar enviroment that users are used to. 

# The Shelf

The clock, battery and WiFi indicators have moved from the Chrome window title bar to an auto-hide dock called the Shelf. I like these indicators to be visible at all time which means I now need to set the Shelf to 'Always visible', which is somewhat annoying because it eats into some of my screen real-estate.

I much prefered it before, when Chrome could use up the entire screen and I could still have the clock always visible.

# Wrapping Up

It's not all bad news. Pasting into the terminal is no longer practically impossible - damn that used to bug me, you can also now edit Google Docs offline and the file manger is a bit nicer. 

Despite this, and the desktop and the shelf getting praise from [techradar](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/new-chrome-os-1082513/review/page:4#articleContent) and [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/29/chrome-os-review-version-19/),  I'm not a fan and Chrome OS has gone a little down hill in my view.
