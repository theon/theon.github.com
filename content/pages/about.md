# About Me

I'm a developer with a background in Java. These days I work in a Labs team at [Net-A-Porter](http://www.net-a-porter.com) as an all-purpose server-side developer which is pretty awesome because I get to play around with lots of different tech every day.  

# About this blog

This blog is powered by [Pelican](http://pelican.notmyidea.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/). Both are free and both are awesome.

I write my posts in markdown, push them to a github repo and then a pelican instance running in Amazon EC2 converts the markdown to HTML and publishes it to this very spot. Check out this [blog article](http://theon.github.com/powering-your-blog-with-pelican-and-git.html) for more on this.
