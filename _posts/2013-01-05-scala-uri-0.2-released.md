Over the Christmas break I merged in the pull requests and resolved the open issues on the scala-uri project. Many thanks to [GentlemanHal](https://github.com/GentlemanHal) and [hgiddens](https://github.com/hgiddens) for your contributions!

scala-uri 0.2 is now available in maven central repository and 0.3-SNAPSHOT is in the OSS Sonatype repository.

The main new feature is now the ability to control the encoding of spaces via an `implicit val`. The default behaviour of scala-uri is still to percent encode spaces as `%20`

    :::scala
    import com.github.theon.uri.Uri._

    val uri:Uri = "http://theon.github.com/uri with space"
    uri.toString //This is http://theon.github.com/uri%20with%20space

However by specifying the following `implicit val`, you can instead have spaces encoded as pluses:

    :::scala
    import com.github.theon.uri.Uri._
    import com.github.theon.uri.Encoders._
    implicit val encoder = PercentEncoder + EncodeSpaceAsPlus

    val uri:Uri = "http://theon.github.com/uri with space"
    uri.toString //This is http://theon.github.com/uri+with+space
